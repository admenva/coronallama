# 3D Supply (COVID-19)

## Why
This pandemic has highlighted how fragile the global supply chains can be. Manufacturers have had a hard time keeping up with the surge in demand and quarantine measures have affected the production of essential protective equipment.

Meanwhile, the 3D printing community has united in the fight against Covid-19. Enthusiasts, companies and health professionals have worked together to prototype and manufacture a wide range of life saving equipment that’s in short supply. These include nasal swabs, ventilator valves, Face shields and other personal protective equipment.

There are various ongoing efforts from volunteers to supply hospitals but the efforts are fragmented. There is a need for a centralized and easy way of finding and communicating between institutions in need of supplies and volunteers. We believe we can make an impact by creating a platform where designers, makers and health care professionals can cooperate to quickly produce equipment that’s urgently needed.

## What it does
Consists of an Android/iOS app that aims to solve short term supply needs of hospitals and other health organizations by matching local demand with local manufacturing.
